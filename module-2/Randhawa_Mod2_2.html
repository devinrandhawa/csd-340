        <p class="intro">
            My name is Devinder, and I live in the city of Portage in Michigan. Growing up, I had a wonderful childhood surrounded by my loving family and friendly neighbors. My favorite hobbies include cooking, sewing, and spending time with my family.

            In my hometown, there is a sense of community and growth that I cherish. Since moving here in 2015, I have grown accustomed to life here. It is a growing community that is developing each and every day with new homes and businesses.

            Cooking has always been a significant part of my life. I started cooking at a young age and have continued to pursue it as a passion. I enjoy experimenting with different recipes and seeing where my creativity can lead me.

            My family is very important to me. I am thankful to have a loving and supportive family who are always by my side. We try to spend as much time together watching movies, going on trips, and sharing stories.
